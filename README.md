## Introduction
Image carousel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description
The project was initially created as a training to display three images in a simple carousel but evolved into an Unsplash art advertisement for selected users that I chose myself. 

![carousel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101952500/185003475-e043c7f5-206d-4689-977e-5d17995bfb20.jpg)

There are two main sections: the art, and the user who created the art. Two arrows are placed on opposite sides to display the previous or next image. Each click presents a new art project along with the artist's infromation which include their name and a link to their art project.

## What I Learned
* [CSS Animation, keyframes](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp)
* [FOR..OF](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_forof.asp)
* [DOM Manipulation](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dom_examples.asp)

## Why I Created This
I took it upon myself to include these artists to give them some exposure for their work, especially those looking for work! Finding that next opportunity can be very difficult and any type of support can be helpful.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScipt
